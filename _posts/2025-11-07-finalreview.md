# Final Review Project

## Introduction

Looking back at this year, I can definitely say I’ve changed a lot as a computer science student. At the start, I was honestly pretty lost, especially during the first few weeks when we were setting up our tools and learning how everything worked. But as the months went on, I started understanding not just how to code, but also how to work with others and how much organization matters in a team project. This blog is basically a reflection on everything I’ve done this year — what went well, what didn’t, and what I’ve learned along the way.

## Sprint 1: Tools and APIs

At the beginning of the year, I struggled a lot with the setup process and just figuring out what to do. My group at the time was really advanced, and while they worked quickly, I often felt left behind. Still, I tried to contribute however I could, and once we started working on projects, I actually enjoyed it a lot.

One of my first contributions was helping with a lesson on APIs, specifically on asynchronous functions and `await`. Later, I worked on an iTunes API project where we expanded on an existing hack. Our version added a search bar that saved results and a genre selector for songs. That project was one of the first times I felt like I was starting to understand how to connect different parts of a program and make something that actually worked and looked good.

Looking back, I think this first sprint taught me the most about *adapting* — learning from others who knew more, figuring things out even when I was confused, and not being afraid to ask questions.

## Sprint 2: Python, JavaScript, and Teamwork

When we switched to the second sprint and formed new groups, things started to change for me. My new team was really organized and made sure everyone had a clear role. It made me realize how important teamwork and communication are — that being good at coding doesn’t matter much if the group can’t work together.

This sprint focused on fundamentals, especially Python and JavaScript. I already knew a bit of Python, so that was mostly review, but JavaScript was new to me. I actually ended up enjoying it a lot because it felt more dynamic and interactive. I also got to help teach a lesson on conditionals, which really helped me understand the topic better. Explaining something out loud makes you notice the small details you might miss otherwise.

The only issue I had during this sprint was that sometimes the homework didn’t line up perfectly with what was taught in class, which made it a bit confusing. But overall, this was when I started feeling a lot more confident in my skills.

## Sprint 3: Digital Famine Project

In the final sprint, I went back to my original group for the Digital Famine project. This time, we were much more organized than before. Everyone had a specific task and we communicated better. I worked mainly on the Vault feature — after completing lessons, users would get a code they could enter into the vault to unlock a scroll as part of our storyline. I also helped with the Vault quiz, which tested everything the player had learned.

If I could change anything, I’d probably spend more time helping with the actual lesson content instead of just the coding side. I tested all the lessons and noticed some parts that could’ve been clearer, but we didn’t have enough time to fix them before the deadline. Still, I was proud of how much better we worked together compared to the first sprint.

## Night at the Museum (N@tM)

Night at the Museum was one of the highlights of the trimester. It felt great to finally show off all our work to other classes and parents. I got a few comments from people who liked the design of the vault and how the scroll idea fit with the rest of the project. It was nice to see people interact with something I helped make — it made all the debugging and small fixes feel worth it.

---

## What’s Next

If I had more time on the project, I’d want to make the vault more interactive. I think it’d be cool to add animations or transitions that make unlocking the scrolls more satisfying. I’d also want to make the lessons feel smoother and more connected to the main game.

Looking forward, I really want to learn more about backend development and how APIs connect to databases. I’m also interested in data analysis and machine learning — I think it’d be interesting to see how the things we learn in class connect to real-world systems.

## Analytics and MCQ Review

Going over my analytics and multiple-choice results helped me realize how much studying habits matter. At first, I just memorized information, but over time I learned that understanding *why* something works matters way more. When reviewing MCQs, I started focusing on finding patterns in what I got wrong and adjusting how I studied.

---

## Something Cool I Learned

One of the coolest things I learned this year was how asynchronous JavaScript actually works. Understanding how `async` and `await` handle promises made me realize how much goes on behind the scenes in web apps. It changed how I think about structuring code — it’s not just about getting it to work, but making it efficient and easy to maintain.

## Conclusion

This year really taught me a lot — not just about programming, but about working with people, staying organized, and learning how to keep improving. At the start, I struggled to even get things set up, and now I can confidently build projects, explain concepts, and collaborate effectively. I still have a lot to learn, but I feel like I’ve built a solid foundation to keep going from here.
