# Final Review Project

## Introduction

Looking back at this year, I can definitely say I've changed a lot as a computer science student. At the start, I was honestly pretty lost, especially during the first few weeks when we were setting up our tools and learning how everything worked. But as the months went on, I started understanding not just how to code, but also how to work with others and how much organization matters in a team project.

This review is organized into different topics covering my journey throughout the trimester. Click on any card below to explore that topic.

## Conclusion

This year really taught me a lot — not just about programming, but about working with people, staying organized, and learning how to keep improving. At the start, I struggled to even get things set up, and now I can confidently build projects, explain concepts, and collaborate effectively. I still have a lot to learn, but I feel like I've built a solid foundation to keep going from here.
