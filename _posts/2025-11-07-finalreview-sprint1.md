# Sprint 1: Tools and Getting Started

## The Struggle of Getting Started

At the start of the year, I had a hard time setting up all the tools. My group was very advanced and moved quickly, so I often didn’t know what I should be doing. I spent a lot of time trying to fix issues with make commands and virtual environments. Everyone else seemed to have their environment running fine while I ran into these small issues, which was frustrating. I also had to figure out Git and GitHub while trying to contribute in small ways. In the end, part of the problem was my really old computer, and after switching to a new one, things got a lot easier.

<strong>Initial Challenges:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Getting make commands to work</li>
  <li>Setting up and activating virtual environments</li>
  <li>Understanding what my teammates were doing</li>
  <li>Learning Git and GitHub basics</li>
  <li>Finding ways to contribute when I wasn’t sure what to do</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Finding My Role

Even with these problems, I tried to contribute wherever I could. Once we started working on projects, I started enjoying the coding. I realized that knowing your tools and environment is important. Once I got my setup working, I felt more confident.

## Working on Class Hacks

One of my first tasks was helping make a lesson for the class hacks on asynchronous functions and the `await` keyword. Teaching the lesson helped me understand the topic better. After that, I worked on an iTunes API project where we added a search bar that saves results and a genre filter. It was not complicated, but it was one of the first projects I completed and it worked as intended.

## Understanding Asynchronous Code

Before making my lesson, I did not understand why data from an API is not available immediately. Learning how asynchronous JavaScript works helped me see why `fetch()` returns a promise and why you need to `await` it. Understanding this made debugging easier and gave me more confidence to work with APIs.

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Skills
- Setting up a working environment from scratch  
- Fixing issues with virtual environments and terminal commands  
- Basic understanding of asynchronous code with `async` and `await`  
- Using Git and GitHub for version control  

### Soft Skills
- Persistence: Working through frustrating setup problems  
- Independence: Figuring out problems on my own  
- Asking questions: Learning that it is better to ask than stay stuck  
- Teaching: Explaining topics helped me understand them better

## What I Would Do Differently

I would ask for help sooner instead of trying to fix everything on my own. I would also take better notes during setup so I wouldn’t have to relearn things later. Overall, this sprint taught me that getting stuck is part of learning and that figuring things out on my own helps build skills.
