# What's Next

## Vault Improvements

The vault works well for unlocking scrolls, but I’d like to make it a bit more engaging.  

<div class="future-section">
<div class="idea-card">
<strong>Better Feedback & Visuals</strong>
- Smooth animation for the vault opening  
- Particle or celebration effects when a scroll is unlocked  
- Optional sound effects  
</div>

<div class="idea-card">
<strong>Progress & Challenge</strong>
- Track collection progress visually  
- Secret scrolls or bonus challenges for more engagement  
</div>

## Learning Goals: AI & Machine Learning

Over the summer, I taught a small, theoretical course on AI and machine learning for a non-profit. That experience made me curious about actually applying these ideas to code. I realized that it’s one thing to understand concepts on paper, but another to see them work in practice.  

<div class="learning-goal">
<h3>Data Analysis & Machine Learning</h3>

**Why This Interests Me:**  
I want to take the theory I taught over the summer and apply it to real data and real projects. It’s exciting to see patterns, make predictions, and solve problems with code.  

**Specific Goals:**  
- Work with pandas and NumPy for data analysis in Python  
- Explore data visualization with matplotlib or seaborn  
- Build a simple machine learning model (classification or regression)  
- Experiment with real datasets, maybe from Kaggle  

**Why It Matters:**  
Data science and machine learning are everywhere. Understanding how it works helps me connect computer science to real-world problems, and it lets me go from theory to actual code I can run and test.
